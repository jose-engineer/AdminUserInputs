# AdminUserInputs Angular App

Implement Angular application mock-up with all required inputs, calculation button and table with results.


## Development server

Install package.json

Run `ng serve` inside 'AdminApp' folder for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

You get mocked fake data from an user object inside ´list-users.component.ts´

Alternatively, the app is ready to run a json-server and make calls to get the data through an angular service(user.service.ts) if needed. Take a look to db.json file and install json-server:
